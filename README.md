# Running the Flask Application on Your IP Address

To run this application on your machine or server with your own IP address, you will need to update the `host` parameter in the code to reflect your specific IP.

## Steps to Run
1. git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>

2. Set Up Virtual Environment 
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
   myenv\scripts\activate        #On Windows

3. Installation
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure Environment Variables
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development     # For development mode
   export DATABASE_URL=mysql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<database>
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_key>

   Modify IP Address 
   python
   # Run the app with your Ip
     if __name__ == '__main__':
         app.run(debug=True,
     host='YOUR_IP_ADDRESS', port=5000)

5. Initialise The Database
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade

6. Run The App Locally 
   flask run

7. OR Deploy With Gunicorn (Recommended)
   sudo fuser -k 8000/tcp
   gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app

8. Access The App On Your Server IP Address or http://localhost:8000

### Known Issues with TensorFlow and GPU Compatibility

Our project encountered a challenge with TensorFlow. The primary issue relates to TensorFlowâ€™s attempt to utilize GPU acceleration. While we tried disabling GPU to force TensorFlow to run on the CPU, the application still seeks a GPU-accelerated environment. This results in potential performance issues for our Flask app.

### Current Limitations

Our web application is accessible at [http://65.20.76.106:8000/](http://65.20.76.106:8000/). However, **User registration and login functionalities are currently not working due to GPU problem**.
